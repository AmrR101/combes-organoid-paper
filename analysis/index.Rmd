Abstract
--------

### Background:

Human kidney organoids hold promise for studying development, disease modelling
and drug screening. However, the utility of stem cell-derived kidney tissues
will depend on how faithfully these replicate normal fetal development at the
level of cellular identity and complexity.

### Results:

Here we present an integrated analysis of single cell datasets from human kidney 
organoids and human fetal kidney to assess similarities and differences between
the component cell types. When overlaid, individual cell clusters contained
cells from both organoid and fetal kidney with transcriptional congruence for
key stromal, endothelial and nephron cell-type specific markers. Organoid
enriched neural, glial and muscle progenitor populations are also evident. Major 
transcriptional differences between organoid and human tissue were likely
related to technical artefacts. Cell type-specific comparisons revealed
differences in stromal, endothelial, and nephron progenitor cell types including
expression of WNT2B in the human fetal kidney stroma but not in the organoids.

### Conclusions:

This study supports the fidelity of kidney organoids as models of the developing 
kidney and affirms their potential in disease modelling and drug screening.
